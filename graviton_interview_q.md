There is another file talking about the process and the test, this is just to add some questions that I had in the interviews that would help out.

## Question 1
Given that 0<y<x<100 and x and y are integers , and (x/y) and ((x+1)/(y+1)) are both integers, find all values of (x,y) that satify these conditions.

## Question 2
A and B are 3x3 matrices that have all integer entires, and the matrices A, A+B, A+2B, A+3B ... A+6B all follow the following properties

1. All the entries are integers.
2. All the matrices are invertible.
3. The inverses of these matrices also have all their entries have integers.

Prove that A+7B also follows these properties. 


## Question 3

### Subpart A
You have a 8*8 chessboard, and you remove the 2 diagonal squares at the ends, Can you place 31 2*1 domino pieces on the chessboard such that all the square pieces are are covered.

### Subpart B
