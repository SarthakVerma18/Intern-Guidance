‚úçÔ∏è Test Pattern
One hour pen-paper test with 4 questions. You are supposed to write descriptive answers like RMO/INMO so basically just be extremely good at maths. The problems are mostly proability based.

They weren‚Äôt expecting you to solve everything. I did 3/4 problems.

üë• Interview Pattern
The interview had 3 rounds -
Round 1: Pure maths questions maybe linear algebra, probability anything. The questions are hard and do not freak out if you cannot solve by yourself they do not expect you to.
They keep giving hints and they want to assess how fast you pick uo those hints and arrive to the answer.

Round 2: This was a bit of HR+technical. It was very very long round and went on for like 90 min and I was fully tired by the end of it. The interviewer wanted to check that every fact I had written on my resume 
was true like  from my projects to the fact that I go to gym. He was pretty friendly but asked some extremely heavy maths questions. I needed like 3-4 hints to solve.

Round 3: This was again maths. I was fully drained after so much of intensive maths so it was a relief when this one lasted 30 min. Again very similar to first two rounds.

TIP- There is only one tip. Don't give up. Ask for more hints but do not say I cannot do this. They want to see your breaking point so do not give them a chance to see it.

TL;DR-
Graviton is probably the best among Indian Quants. All people seemed pretty nice and work culture is good. They also have a ppo conversion rate fo about 80%.
Its a good place to be in and if you want to crack their interview practice some good amount of intensive maths mostly probability.
