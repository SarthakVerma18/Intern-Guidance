### üí° Tips

- Throughly prepare problems from the above resources and supplement with other sources like problems from Hackerrank as a way to test yourself and adapt. A lot of questions that were asked both in the tests and the interviews are some version of probelems from the above resources.
- Don't panic during the interviews, I had a mess up during my second question in the interview, but the interviewer guided me through it and helped me arrive at an optimal solution.
- Always be willing to adapt your solution on spot based on the interviewer's feedback. Try not to get stuck with trying to make something work while ignoring feedback.
