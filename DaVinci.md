### ✍️ Test Pattern

There was a **20-minute test** with **19 questions**.  
All questions demanded you to be **intuitively correct**.

They weren’t expecting you to use **pen and paper** to get to the answer. It’s just that after reading the question, you should have a **rough idea** of what the answer should be.

In some questions, they didn’t even expect an exact value — a **rough approximation** was **good enough**.

### 🗣️ GD Pattern (Group Discussions)

There were **3 GD rounds** before getting selected for interviews.

All three were based on a **market-making game** where the **fair value depended on the probability** of a certain event.

#### 🎲 Setup (Same in all rounds):

- 4 dice:  
  - 1 with **4 sides**  
  - 1 with **6 sides**  
  - 1 with **8 sides**  
  - 1 with **10 sides**

Then there were questions like:
- Probability of rolling and getting **3 unique numbers**
- Probability of getting **2 unique numbers**
- Probability of getting a **minimum of 4**, etc.

You had to calculate this and then **quote buy/sell prices** based on expected value.

### ❌ Mistakes Made / 💡 Tips

- I **messed up** the **market-making game**, and hence couldn’t get an offer  
  - I was able to **calculate the answers properly**, but got confused while calling **Buy or Sell**, which resulted in **elimination**

📌 No one from **Elec** was able to get an offer in **Da Vinci**  
Only **1 CS guy** ended up getting it

💥 But the company is **too good**, and it’s definitely **worth putting efforts** for this company and this profile.
