# Goedel Machines- Moonshot Division Intern

### 🧠 Role Overview:

- **Company**: Goedel Machines
- **Designation**: Engineering Intern (R&D)
- **Mode**: In-office (Hyderabad, tentatively)


### 📌 Internship Description:

The Moonshot Division Engineering Internship is a research-focused role centered on the **design and development of deterministically verifiable computational systems**. Interns are expected to engage with foundational ideas in symbolic reasoning ad mechanical verification. The work involves creating systems whose correctness and improvement can be **verified objectively without reliance on human labels, probabilistic heuristics, or black-box models**. This opens the door to scalable, safe, self-improving programs that don’t need regular human intervention to stay aligned.


### 🧪 Proposal-Based Selection:

- Applicants were first required to **submit a detailed proposal** outlining a system where self-modifying symbolic agents could be applied. A 20-day submission window was provided, with optional early feedback for proposals submitted within the first week.
- Shortlisted candidates were then invited to a **Group Discussion (GD) round**, where they presented their ideas and engaged in peer cross-questioning to assess depth of understanding and clarity of reasoning.
- The final round was an **interview**, which focused primarily on current advancements in the fields related to our proposals, followed by HR questions.

### 📚 Preparation:

- Since each applicant was required to submit a unique proposal, there was no standard technical preparation needed for the selection process. Instead, candidates were expected to have a good understanding of their own proposal and be able to defend its logic and feasibility.
- The team also shared a set of reference materials and write-ups, highlighting what constitutes a successful proposal.


### 💡 Tips and Remarks:

- One of the key advantages of the selection process was the option to get feedback. Many of the candidates who struggled during the Group Discussion hadn’t submitted early enough to benefit from structured feedback. Taking that opportunity helps refine your ideas and anticipate the kinds of questions you'll face.
- One nice thing about this process is that it doesn’t require you to “grind” for preparation. There are no coding rounds or problem sets to cram. If you enjoy thinking deeply about systems, logic, and structure and you're excited about building something truly novel, this process can be incredibly rewarding. I personally had a lot of fun with it, and I hope you do too!
