# 🚀 JPMC SGEP Internship

---

## 📌 JPMC SGEP Overview

* JPMC SGEP is a new intern role introduced for our batch only (EE’23 && CS’23)
* It has been available for placements for 3 years
* It is an SDE role; SGEP is just the program name

---

## 💼 About the Role

* JPMC is developing the **Chase App** for European customers
* Think of it as credit + many other financial services + digital banking; one-stop solution for any financial issue in Europe
* I need to experience it once my internship starts
* This app is developed and maintained by SGEP office members (SGEP = Strategic Growth Engineering Program)

---

## 📝 Selection Process

* **Test** → It was very, very easy. I think they gave a wrong test or it was a mistake—it was so easy (code was only \~10 lines for one question and \~3 lines for the other).

* **Shortlist Criteria** → Not based on test score (too easy), so they used resume shortlist

* **Interview**

  * **Round 1 → DSA**

    * (1 easy, 1 medium question)
    * Time: 30 min
    * Easy question → Find the next greatest element for every element in the array in O(n)
    * Medium question → A running stream of numbers: update mean, median, mode in O(log(n)) time per insert
    * Time is key here

  * **Round 2 → OOP and System Design**

    * Note: no advanced system design; they ask standard  questions like vending machine or parking lot, and if you’re not CS they guide you
    * OOP → explain the four pillars: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance

  * **Round 3 → Didn't happen to me**

    * If they have doubts or want to give another chance before rejecting, they use a DSA second round. Very few go through Round 3; most move to Round 4 or are sent back after Round 2.

  * **Round 4 → HR**

    * Be thorough with your resume
    * Have answers customized to JPMC for “Tell me about yourself,” your strengths and weaknesses, etc.
    * Be confident
    * Have a question ready when they ask you

## 🔧 Required Skills

1. DSA & OOP (many neglect OOP but most companies ask it)
2. If CS students then system design; if ECE, learn the two problems: vending machine and parking lot
3. Confidence and keeping the interviewer in the loop (most important skill) and driving the interview in the direction you want

## 📚 Tips and Prep Material

* **DSA** → Striver sheet or institute’s DSA sheet
* **OOP** → [https://www.notion.so/Internship-Prep-SDE-20f4d997d0d180399527cdf714984a64](https://www.notion.so/Internship-Prep-SDE-20f4d997d0d180399527cdf714984a64)
* **System Design** → Just be ready with those two questions
* **Mock Interviews** → Ask your friends to take your resume and ask questions. Note that the test is a registration filter (they try to reject people) but the interview is the selection process

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

**For this Role**

* Not practicing heaps & statistical questions (mean, median, mode). Leetcode focus on DP & graphs—but they asked fundamentals, so be thorough with fundamentals; many neglect heaps/math questions in Striver or institute sheets

**General Mistake**

* Not applying to quant companies. I thought quant companies were only for people from another planet to crack and need high cg and high JEE rank, but with good math prep, you can crack them!
