### ‚úçÔ∏è Test Pattern(Gave both trading and quant test together )

There was one test which was **quite lengthy but very basic**.  
They will probably expect almost **100% accuracy** as the test is pretty easy.

The test consisted of many sections ‚Äî if I recall correctly, it included:  
- **Quantitative aptitude**  
- **Probability** (All were easy-medium) 
- **English**  
- **Verbal English**-This Incuded Listening to a conversation or some news and then answering some questions based on that, try to be attentive of every small detail being spoken.Also A speaking round where you had to speak for 45 seconds on spot for a topic which they'll provide.
- **Finance**  
- **Programming**(One DSA Question Easy-Medium Difficulty)

All the sections were **super easy**, you just need to be **a little attentive** while giving the test.  
üëâ **Don‚Äôt make silly errors.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**:  
- There‚Äôs **no navigation allowed**  
- If you **skip** a question or **answer it wrongly**, you **cannot go back** to it

Mostly Solving all or almost all questions correctly will get you an **interview call**.

### üë• Interview Pattern

There were **4 rounds of interviews**:

1. **Round 1: Resume Questioning**  
   - So for me I had a Trading Project with a Quant firm on my resume , he asked me a lot of questions regarding that, How does Trading work, what is Stop Loss how is it beneficial/when it isnt (in an illiquid market).Questions regarding Technical analysis and trading different derivatives etc.
   - Then he asked me questions regarding the recent event that took place which was the Jane Street ban in 2025(For peeps reading this after do read about it), How exactly they were manipulating the market(hiking price and selling put options) and making huge amounts of money.Had to explain from the basics as that's what he was looking for.  
     üëâ So make sure to go through ur resume thoroughly and be aware if eny big recent events that may have taken place.

2. **Round 2: Probab and Bonds related questions**  
   - Focused on **Probabilty questions**, some dice questions a markov chain question.If you have done the books mentioned below you should be fine,try to explain to the interviewer your thought process as well if a question is taking time.  
   - Then asked some bonds related questions, but i didnt have much knowledge regarding that so tried answering by intuition only, beneficial to have some  fixed income security(bonds) knowledge but not necessary, they were mostly looking for if I was quick to learn the concept and then answer a qn on it.
   

3. **Round 3: Finance Round**  
   - Here first he asked me about various **financial terms**, related to some projects on my resume.(Asked about FX swap etc ). Again it depends entirely on your resume what they will ask you.
   - After this again he asked me about  a recent major event which was trump imposing high import tariffs on various commodities. He asked me how these tariffs would affect  the inflation rate/repo rates, how that affects  the interest rate  etc.I didnt have knowledge about the relationships, But by intuition I gave my thought process and what I think should happen by logical thinking.The Interviewer was impressed.

4. **Round 4: HR Round**  
   - A **very chill and lite round**  
   - She asked me about my **strengths and weaknesses**(Don't try saying you dont have any weakness, Thats a turn off I would say) 
   - Try to be **honest** and **interact properly**  
   - Don‚Äôt be hesitant to **ask questions** if you have any
