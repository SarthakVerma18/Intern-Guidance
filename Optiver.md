🧪 Test Pattern

The test had two parts for the Quant Trading role:

  1. Sequences Section (26 Qs in 25 minutes)
  This round has negative marking — do not attempt questions unless you are absolutely confident. You need to be extremely fast at identifying patterns.
  Practice is key here — speed and accuracy are everything.

  2. Probability Section (45 minutes)
  Each question had a fixed timer (90 seconds). It was not feasible to solve every question fully in the given time — instead, you're expected to estimate and pick a range (e.g., 25–50, 50–75, etc.).
  The focus is on your intuition, estimation skills, and how well you handle pressure.

For FPGA/Software roles, the test included:
  Some multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
  One coding question

🗣️ Group Discussion (GD) Pattern

One key thing to understand: GD is not just about getting the correct answer. They're evaluating:

  1. Your ability to communicate clearly
  2. How you listen, respond, and collaborate under pressure

Interestingly, the GD questions were the same for all three roles — Quant, FPGA, and Software. Some tech candidates were frustrated, but the aim is to evaluate your presence of mind and collaborative problem-solving, not technical depth.

Format:
  5 people per group
  Each person gets a slip with 4 commodities (e.g., silver, gold, copper, platinum) and conversion rates
  
  Example: 4 Gold → 3 Platinum, 1 Platinum → 2 Silver, etc.
  Sample Questions:
  Given 4 Gold coins, what’s the minimum number of trades to get 6 Gold?
  Now find trades to get 100 Gold coins
  Based on your approach above, estimate for 1 million Gold coins

(There were 2 more questions but I don’t recall the exact wording. They were similar in style.)

Tips:
  1. KEEP TALKING – They want to hear your thought process
  2. Take initiative and distribute tasks: “You try converting gold → platinum, I’ll check the reverse path…”
  3. Don’t dominate — make sure to include others. Be logical, structured, and calm under pressure

💬 Interview Pattern

The technical interview revolved around a market-making / betting game.

Format:
  15 probability questions (based on dice, cards, coins)
  You’re given 5 minutes to calculate expected values
  Then, you enter a 10-minute trading round
  
  Start with 1000 coins
  Trade based on EV vs. quoted odds
  Odds keep changing dynamically after each trade

  Goal: maximize your profit

Example:
  You're given odds for an event like “3 Heads in a row”
  Calculate fair odds based on EV

  If quoted odds are better than fair odds → good trade
  But be alert — the market keeps changing!

After the simulation:
They may ask estimation questions:
  “How many primes < 1000?”
  “Probability of getting 50 heads in 100 tosses?”

You're expected to answer these in under 30 seconds — it’s about intuition, not precision.

🧠 What I Did Well vs. Could’ve Done Better

I ended with a 3000 coin profit, which is decent, but here’s what I could improve:

  1. Didn’t use all 15 events — not enough time to calculate every EV
      Instead, I should’ve bet small amounts on unknowns, then updated my estimates from outcomes

  2. Didn’t size trades optimally — should’ve placed larger bets on clearly favorable odds
  3. There were risky bid/ask options I avoided — I explained this decision to the interviewer

Tip: They don’t expect perfection. But they do want to see how you reason and how well you can learn from your mistakes — so explain everything you're thinking out loud.

🧑‍💼 Behavioral Round

Optiver takes behavioral interviews seriously — they’ve even rejected candidates without a technical round due to a poor behavioral fit.

Format:
Lasts ~30 minutes

HRs ask rapid-fire questions and follow up with deep probing

Sample Questions:
  What are the top 3 qualities needed at Optiver?
  Which of these is your weakest, and why?
  In a team setting, what would people come to you for?
  Resume-related and situational questions

Tips:
  Be smartly honest — don’t try to bluff, they’ll know.
  They ask follow-ups on everything.
  Support every trait you claim with concrete examples.

⚡ TL;DR – Final Advice
The core things Optiver tests are your reasoning, your response time, and your composure under pressure.
Most people mess up not because of a lack of ability, but because of stress.

So:

Stay calm

Think logically

Be vocal

And apply your brain — that’s all they want.
