### ‚úçÔ∏è Test Pattern

There was one online test of **120 mins**. It had 2 sections of 12 questions each on **Olympiad/JEE level mathematics (probability, statistics, geometry, puzzles, games etc), DSA concepts and AI/ML**. Majority of the questions were of math though. 

**Section-1**: MCQ - 12 questions.
- Questions were **single and multiple options correct**. 
- About 7 of them were on **Mathematics** on concepts like Probability, Combinatorics, Number Theory, **Olympiad Math**, etc. About 4 of them has questions on **DSA and time complexity**. 1/2 of them had some **AI/ML concept** involved.
- **+4** for all correct options chosen, **partial marks** awarded for choosing a subset of correct answers (and no wrong answer chosen), **0** for all other cases
  
**Section-2**: Numericals - 12 questions.
  - All the questions were on  **Mathematics** on concepts like Probability, Combinatorics, Number Theory, Geometry, **Olympiad Math,** etc
  - **+4** for correct answer, **0** for wrong.

There were no programming questions :)

### üë• Interview Pattern
- There were **3-4 rounds of interviews**, some offline, while some online with the panelists. 
- The rounds were **focused on Mathematics, problem solving and puzzles**. 
- Be very clear with your **resume**, the **past projects and internships** that you have done. In case you have done a **finance project**, especially in the area of Quant Research, be prepared to **answer any sorts of questions** on it.

üìå **Key Insight**: For the interview, **Problem-solving and resume preparedness are the most important things**.

### üìö Resources Used

- **Brainstellar**
- *50 Challenging Problems in Probability*
- *Heard on the Street*
- *The Green Book* for Maths, Probability and Puzzles
- **ChatGPT** to learn some basic finance stuff (if interested ‚Äî otherwise keep it lite)

### üí° Tips

- Always speak your thoughts out. 
- Try to solve questions **intuitively**.
- Be very comfortable with **theoretical topics of probability** ‚Äî basically anything taught in **EEProbab or MAProbab** should be on your tips. That helps *a lot* in interviews.
- Don't go **silent** in the interview. If there‚Äôs any question you feel you don‚Äôt know the answer to, you can always try:
  - Asking for **hints**
  - Attempting it anyway ‚Äî the interviewer will often **guide you**

### ‚úÖ All the best for your preparation!!
