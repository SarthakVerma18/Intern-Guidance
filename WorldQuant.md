### ✍️ Test Pattern

There was one online test of **120 mins**. It had 2 sections of 12 questions each on **Olympiad/JEE level mathematics (probability, statistics, geometry, puzzles, games etc), DSA concepts and AI/ML**. Majority of the questions were of math though. 
1st section had MCQs with single and multiple options correct questions. The 2nd section had numerical based questions.

There were no programming questions :)

### 👥 Interview Pattern

There were **3-4 rounds of interviews**, some offline, while some online with the panelists. 

The rounds were **focused on Mathematics, problem solving and puzzles**. 

There were also questions based on what I wrote in my **resume**.  
👉 So if you write any technical terms, especially related to **finance**, in your resume — **be sure you can explain them**. 

📌 **Key Insight**: For the interview, **Problem-solving is the most important thing**.

### 📚 Resources Used

- **Brainstellar**
- *50 Challenging Problems in Probability*
- *Heard on the Street*
- *The Green Book* for Maths, Probability and Puzzles
- **ChatGPT** to learn some basic finance stuff (if interested — otherwise keep it lite)

### 💡 Tips

- Always speak your thoughts out. 
- Try to solve questions **intuitively**.
- Be very comfortable with **theoretical topics of probability** — basically anything taught in **EEProbab or MAProbab** should be on your tips. That helps *a lot* in interviews.
- Don't go **silent** in the interview. If there’s any question you feel you don’t know the answer to, you can always try:
  - Asking for **hints**
  - Attempting it anyway — the interviewer will often **guide you**
