# 📌 D. E. SHAW Intern Experience — Technology Developer Role

---

### ✍️ **Test Pattern**

- Duration: **60 minutes**
- Format: **3 programming questions**
- Topics: **Strings, Graphs, Arrays**
- 🔄 **Auto-switching:** Each question had a specific time limit, and the platform automatically moved to the next one after time expired.

🧠 **Note**: The focus is **heavily on programming**. I wasn’t able to fully solve all the questions, but I tried to pass as many test cases as possible — **that was enough to get the interview call**.

### 👥 **Interview Rounds**

There were **3 offline interview rounds**, all conducted in person by D. E. SHAW panelists.

#### 🟢 Round 1:
- Focus: **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Extra: Questions from my **resume**

#### 🟡 Round 2 & 3:
- Focus: **DSA + OOPS**
- Topics included:
  - Arrays
  - Data structure design

### 📚 **Resources I Used**
**Geeks For Geeks and LEETCODE FOR PRACTISE**
- **Striver’s Sheet** (DSA)
- **Neetcode 150**
- YouTube channels for quick concept revision and problem walkthroughs

### 💡 **Tips for You**

- Start preparation **early** — don't wait till the last month.
- Get very **comfortable with DSA**, especially arrays, strings,hash maps,Trees and basic design problems.
- Be ready for **low-level implementation questions** — like how memory is managed for vectors internally.
- ❌ Don’t go **silent** in interviews:
  - Ask for hints if you're stuck.
  - Explain your thought process — **interviewers appreciate your approach**, not just the final answer.
