### ✍️ Test Pattern

There was one online test of **60 mins**. It had **10 or 12 questions on pure mathematics** (probability, statistics, geometry, puzzles) and **2 questions on programming** (these were decent questions on string manipulation and dynamic programming). 

I think **GS primarily focuses on Maths more than programming**. I wasn't able to solve the programming questions fully, but I **solved all the maths questions**, and that was good enough for me to get an interview call.

### 👥 Interview Pattern

There were **3 rounds of interview** for GS Quant — all **offline** with panelists. 

All three rounds were **focused on Mathematics**, and consisted of around **5–6 questions** on different types of math problems and counter-questions based on your responses.

There were also questions based on what I wrote in my **resume**.  
👉 So if you write any technical terms, especially related to **finance**, in your resume — **be sure you can explain them**.

There was just **one basic programming question** where I was asked to write **any sorting algorithm** of my choice on paper.

📌 **Key Insight**: For the interview, **Maths is the most important thing**.

### 📚 Resources Used

- **Brainstellar**
- *50 Challenging Problems in Probability*
- *Heard on the Street*
- *The Green Book* for Maths, Probability and Puzzles
- **Neetcode 150** and some YouTube channels for programming basics
- **Aditya Verma YouTube videos** for Dynamic Programming — *the best thing I have seen in my life*
- **ChatGPT** to learn some basic finance stuff (if interested — otherwise keep it lite)
- **STAT 101** from Stanford — *one of the best courses for Probability and Stats*

### ❌ Mistakes Made

- Started prep **a little late**, so had to struggle a lot in the end.
- Focused very **less on programming**, as it was a little uninteresting to me.

🔁 **Don't make these mistakes.**

### 💡 Tips

- Try to solve questions **intuitively**.
- Be very comfortable with **theoretical topics of probability** — basically anything taught in **EEProbab or MAProbab** should be on your tips. That helps *a lot* in interviews.
- Don't go **silent** in the interview. If there’s any question you feel you don’t know the answer to, you can always try:
  - Asking for **hints**
  - Attempting it anyway — the interviewer will often **guide you**

### ✅ All the best for your preparation!!
