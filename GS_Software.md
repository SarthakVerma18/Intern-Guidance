##Test Shortlist 
Everyone who applied got shortlist for the test (open to all departments), I dont think there was any CGPA cutoff.

##Test 
The test was one hour long, and had 3 math questions, 3 coding questions, one hr question where you had to give an essay answer, 5-6 questions on CS fundamentals (Implementation of data structures, OOPS etc). The difficulty of the test wasnt too hard, but time was very less, so speed was important.
There was negative marking for all the non coding questions, so please read the instructions and dont guess unreasonably. 
I dont remember the questions exactly, but it was one dp question, one graph question, and one tic tac toe solver. (quite basic tho)
I had solved all the math and CS fundamentals questions, and 2 out of the 3 coding questions, and got an interview shortlist.

##Interview 
The interview process had 3 rounds, and they were eliminatory in nature (i.e you had a round 2 only if you passed the first round), and each 
round was around 45mins - 1hr. For all the rounds, they required us to just write pseudo code and explain with paper pen, we never actually ran the code.

##Round 1
The first round the asked me to count the number of valid parenthesis, and also had to explain how to take care of invalid inputs etc. Then she asked
me to make a vending machine system where you had to represent each item as a queue and also check if item existed and make a proper refund system. 
The she asked some hr questions based on my resume (my resume was elec heavy, so I had to properly justify why I liked this field). 

##Round 2
The second round I had to implement a class for a cab service like uber, where I had to take input data as coordinates for the cabs, and had to write a practical
algorithm on how I would assign a cab to a passenger, I was asked to make it as practical as possible, and also then modify the algorithm for different types
of cabs etc. He was very particular on the type of data structures I used to different data and the different functions in used in the class. I had to justify 
why I chose to do something at every single step, then I had to explain some project I had in my resume (like properly grilled lol).

##Round 3
Third round was with some main guy, and the question was an interesting one, here it is:
You have some currency exchange system, such that

INR:GDP :: 120:1
USD:INR :: 85:1
GDP:USD :: 1:0.85

(Please forgive me if the numbers dont make sense, i dont remember the q exactly)
Now the first question was if you could make a profit given this data.

The second question was, given n different currencies with their conversions specified, could you find all the different starting currencies from which you could make a profit, and you had to write a code for it.
The question is very similar to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8DGdPkBBxg&t=1287s.


##Preparation
Just blindly follow strivers a/z sheet, forget everything else, helped me with a lot of other software and quant tests/interviews.
Since i was preparing for quants too, id say do green book for probability and puzzles.
For oops and cs fundamentals, I read geeks for geeks, and taking ob dsa in 4th sem made it very easy to go through dsa when sem 4 ended.


##Advise
The 2 months after sem 4 is more than enough if you work consistently, give it your best shot and dont get demotivated by comparing to other people.
Dont neglect topics like OOPs if you are serious about sde roles. Id say try to develop your thinking ability during your sem 3 and 4 and explore as many things as possible.
For GS especially, please know every single point of your resume properly. Also do acads properly and dont let you cg fall.
