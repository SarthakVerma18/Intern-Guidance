## ‚úçÔ∏è Test
Pattern: 2 questions, 75 minutes

Topics: 1-D Dynamic Programming, DFS

Difficulty: Trivial questions. Don't think too much and apply your brain. The testcases were hidden so make sure to practice coming up with testcases.

Tips: Questions were lite so no special prep.

## üó£Ô∏è GD (Group Discussions)
Pattern: 8 in a group. For around 2 hours.

Topics: System design. We were given a resource manager class and had to find bugs/optimizations on the code. Try to imagine where that code is being deployed, it helps to come up with effecient alternatives.

Difficulty: Easy. I had experience doing this kind of stuff from my time at a competition team and a project. Yet, there were many that struggled and were eliminated.

Tips: Try doing a project that involves building a system/API. Somehow develop a way of thinking about designing software at a higher level.

## üë• Interview
Pattern: 3 rounds. 2 technical and 1 HR. around 1:30 hrs

Topics: Data structure design and implementation. First round was a discussion about what data structures to use for the problem. Be clear with your maps, linked lists, sets, hash map etc. Second round was implementation of a functionality along the lines of what was discussed in the previous round. 


Difficulty: Medium. I personally messed up in the first part of the interview by not reading the problem statement properly. The interviewers were amazing though and we worked through the problem from scratch. 

PLEASE read everything properly( I lowkey died when I realized my mistake ).
Although keep in mind that getting the right solution from the get go is (probably) not the point of the interview. It is to test how you think on your feet and how you communicate your thoughts and soultions(I managed to do that pretty well after the initial mistaek).

Tips: This was my first (offical) interview and it was the best experience I could have asked for. My nerves calmed down pretty quickly and the 2 hours of technical felt like a discussion with friends. Getting into that zone of not caring about the result and simply trying your best to figure out the problem in front of you was what I felt got me through( it sends a chill down my spine even thinking about the stakes and how calm I was despite that)


NOTE: I have not described the questions in full detail. That is because I felt the whole process was "fair". They did not ask underhanded questions( looking at you quantbox ) which no 2nd year would know nor was the process based on random chance. 

If the process is "fair", then why should we not be? I have left out the exact questions for this very reason. It is doable to begin with and reading this will probably not make it any more doable.

## Why IMC?
PPO conversion is good unlike other quants(read optiver). Although it is an indian role there will be a degree of international exposure(not available in indian quants). Pay is really nice. What else do you need? A life?
