### ‚úçÔ∏è Test Pattern

There were 2 online tests.

**Test-1**: 80 in 8.
- You had to solve **80 Arithmetic questions under 8 mins**. For example 21 / __ = 3, Options : 4, 5, 6, 7. And 25 * 12 = __ Options : 100, 200, 300, 400. 
- **+1** for correct answer, **-1** for wrong.
  
**Section-2**: Series questions.
  - There were **26 questions to be solved in 25 mins**. 
  - **+1** for correct answer, **-1** for wrong.\
  - You can choose to skip questions and come back to solve them later. 

There were no programming questions :)

### üí° Tips for the tests
- If you are an **NTSE scholar** or have **cleared aptitude exams**, you are at an advantage.
- **Have a good night's sleep**, so that you are able to **focus** better during the tests. Most importantly **be calm**.
- I did not practice any resources for the tests, but I have heard of this thing called 'Zetamac' after giving the test. There are also a bunch of resources online if you **just type 80 in 8** on google. Same goes for practising series questions.
- Its advisable not to guess answers to questions in the series section. You can always just skip and do later if you have time. 

### üë• Interview Pattern
- There were **2 rounds of interviews**, both online. 
- The rounds were **focused on Probability and Expectation Value**. 
- Be very clear with your **resume**, the **past projects and internships** that you have done. In case you have done a **finance project**, especially in the area of Quant Research, be prepared to **answer any sorts of questions** on it.
- Speak out your thoughts, and answer stuff **intuitively**.

### üìö Resources Used
For the tests, you just need a **calm mind, proper focus and more importantly a good night's sleep**.
For the interviews, you can refers to resources like:
- **Brainstellar**
- *50 Challenging Problems in Probability*
- *Heard on the Street*
- *The Green Book* for Maths, Probability and Puzzles
- **ChatGPT** to learn some basic finance stuff (if interested ‚Äî otherwise keep it lite)

### üí° Tips

- Always speak your thoughts out. 
- Try to solve questions **intuitively**.
- Be very comfortable with **theoretical topics of probability** ‚Äî basically anything taught in **EEProbab or MAProbab** should be on your tips. That helps *a lot* in interviews.
- Don't go **silent** in the interview. If there‚Äôs any question you feel you don‚Äôt know the answer to, you can always try:
  - Asking for **hints**
  - Attempting it anyway ‚Äî the interviewer will often **guide you**
