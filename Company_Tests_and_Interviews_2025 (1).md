Coding \-   
1\. BFS \+ Binary Search \- move in a grid to maximize minimum Manhattan distance from blocked nodes  
 2\. Trees \+ DP  
Tree with n nodes rooted at 0\. Nodes are from 0 to n-1. n-1 edges. Edges are from g\_from\[i\] to   
G\_to\[i\]. Each node has arr\[i\]. Collect values at nodes using one of 2 methods:  
\-\> Collect arr\[i\]-k  
\-\> Collect floor(arr\[i\]/2) \-\> If this is chosen, then all values of node j on the nodes subtree are changed to floor(arr\[i\]/2). Can only collect the value at a node if it’s parent’s value has been collected before (except the root). Maximize the total.

**14\. Optiver**  
No games etc. this year, only NumberLogic (Sequences) and BeatTheOdds (Probab). Sequences was easy to medium, 26 questions in 25 mins. Probability was extremely tough with a lot of time pressure (30 questions, 1.5 min per question).

You are at a vertex of a decagon, toss a coin to go CW or ACW. Expected number of tosses to reach the opposite end, expected number of tosses to reach back to where you are.  
Pick 2 3 digit numbers, probab that there diff is \< 100

Expected sum you get if you roll a dice til you get the same number consecutively:

Expected number of rolls to get the same number consecutively: You do the first roll. Then E\[N\] \= ⅙(1) \+ ⅚(1 \+ E\[N\]) \=\> Gives E\[N\] \= 6, so total 6 \+ 1 \= 7 rolls. This makes the answer 3.5 \* 7 \= 24.5

Need a lot of speed and very fast estimation of numbers

O(N^2) or O(N^3) is easy, but they need O(N)

1. Given arr, count for each element how many other elements are a divisor or multiple, 1 \<= n,arr\[i\] \<= 10^5  
2. Given vector of strings, find how many pairs ((i,j), (j,i) are same) exist s.t their concatenation can be rearranged to form a palindrome. 1\<=n\<=10^5, 1\<=length(array\[i\]) \<= 3\*10^5, 1 \<= sum of lengths of strings \<= 3\*10^5  
3. Implement a function htat determines the minimum number of operations needed to transform binary string s to binary string t. 1\<=n\<=3\*10^5. In one operation, you can swap s\[i\],s\[j\] if s\[i\] \= 0 and s\[i+1\] \= …. \= s\[j\] \= 1 OR s\[i\] \= ….=s\[j-1\] \= 1 and s\[j\] \= 0  
4. Using the following rules, find the minimum cost needed to reach any integer oint on the number line. Rules: Start at x=0. For each available distance in distance\[i\], the cost to move to any point x\!= distance\[i\] is cost\[i\]. After paying the cost to use distance\[i\], you can moveto distance\[i\] an infinite number of times without any additional cost.

**18\. DaVinci GD**

**7-8 ppl in one zoom meeting room \- Question: You have 4 dice A,B,C,D. A has 4 faces with numbers 1,2,3,4, B has 6, C has 8, D has 10\. They ask a probability question which is like the fair price (in percentage), after which they randomly ask someone to make a market on that fair price and others have to continuously buy/sell. Saying buy or sell immediately, as soon as you hear a quote is paramount. If you don’t then that means you’re slow or didn’t get the answer yet, which is a big red flag. IT seemed to be the only differentiator to get shortlisted. Get the method to get the probability quickly, and in another 10 seconds convert it to decimal as fast as you can.**

**We didn’t have to remember our trades and PnL, but that’s an obvious next step**

**Note: 5% wide market just means ask-bid \= spread \= 5%. Example: 14%, 19%**

**Questions:**

1. **Probab that all 4 get different numbers (4\*5\*6\*7/4\*6\*8\*10)**  
2.  **Probability that all show same number (4/4\*6\*8\*10)**  
3. **Probab that exactly one is 7 (⅛ \* 9/10 \+ ⅞ \* 1/10)**  
4. **We get a 3, probab that we get it from the 4 face die (simple Bayes theorem)**  
5. **Ratio of probab to get 3 unique to 2 unique (very tough to get exact, asked to estimate in 5 seconds \- guessed 2 to 2.2, answer is around 5\)**

**19\. Optiver GD**

**Simple commodity trading setup, with unidirectional trade between gold, silver, platinum, copper, oil. You start with some amount of gold and need to maximize the amount of gold you can get after doing a certain number of trades, etc. 4-5 rounds each 5-6 mins long. 4 people in each group, need to discuss together and tell the optimal solution. Essentially need to find cycles that start and end at gold. Can only trade integer parts of any commodity. Not sure on what basis they judged people and selected.**

**20\. IMC GD**

**Had 2 parts, total around 1:30 hr. First part was about analysing the order book for some market of fruits and the trade volumes and valuations made by some company (FTX). You need to figure out FTXs trading strategy and what you can improve in that. You were allowed to request for data sorted according to a particular column. Strategy was that it trades a fixed volume if credit (theoretical fair price \- actual price) is above 0.2 else trade 0 volume. Mostly just check days when it makes losses to know how to improve the trading strategy. Possible improvements were to trade more volume when the credit is higher upto some limit and again drop it down as credit increases further. Also if FTX’s volume is the majority of the market share then decrease the volume \- more market share of volume was indicating more losses. Also when the total volume is very high, you can trade higher volume as it means there is strong impression in the market, and it would be a safer bet.**

**Second part was market making game on a guesstimate \- the cheapest price of business class ticket from Chennai to Sydney with a maximum of 2 stops in the next 24 hrs.**

**First asked for a fair and and 20% wide market (width \= 20% of fair price) and also 90,95 and 99% confidence intervals (not mathematically, just your best guess upto that confidence level).**  
**Then market making game started with all the 9 people in the GD group \- need to give bid-ask quotes or only one sided quotes and continuously trade. Daily position limit is \+/- 10, final position limit is \+/- 3\. Maxkimum of 10 trades. At last, need to report the PnL and final positions.**

**21\. Goldman Sachs \- 3 sections 1 hr**

3rd Round:

Given a matrix m\*n to be filled with 0s and 1s, what is the number of ways you can fill the matrix such that every row and every col has even parity.

Resume grilling round. Introduce yourself, then why quant, pick a project you like, went deep into that. Asked for the meanings and checked understanding very in-depth about any terminology used.Why do you think probability and expected value is asked for quant interviews? What can be improved in your project? How can you tell if the outputs of it are good?
