### ✍️ Test Pattern

There was one test which was **quite lengthy but very basic**.  
They will probably expect **100% accuracy** as the test is very easy.

The test consisted of many sections — if I recall correctly, it included:  
- **Quantitative aptitude**  
- **Probability**  
- **English**  
- **Verbal English**  
- **Finance**  
- **Programming**

All the sections were **super easy**, you just need to be **a little attentive** while giving the test.  
👉 **Don’t make silly errors.**

⚠️ **Important**:  
- There’s **no navigation allowed**  
- If you **skip** a question or **answer it wrongly**, you **cannot go back** to it

I think I solved all the questions correctly — and hence got an **interview call**.

### 👥 Interview Pattern

There were **4 rounds of interview**:

1. **Round 1: Maths Round**  
   - Focused on **Probability**, **Statistics**, and **Puzzles**  
   - Most of the probability questions required **Markov Chains**  
     👉 So make sure to go through that topic

2. **Round 2: CS Fundamentals Round**  
   - Focused on **basic computer science concepts**  
   - Since I hadn’t mentioned any data structures course on my resume, the questions were **pretty chill and easily doable**  
   - Make sure you **know everything you’ve written** on your resume — questions were asked to me based on the entire **technical stack** I mentioned

3. **Round 3: Programming Round**  
   - Asked to write code for a **DP problem**  
   - I gave **2 different ideas** and then wrote the **most optimal code** — the interviewer was impressed  
   - One more question involved **basic OOPS knowledge**

4. **Round 4: HR Round**  
   - A **very chill round**  
   - She asked questions about things on my **resume**  
   - Try to be **honest** and **interact properly**  
   - Don’t be hesitant to **ask questions** if you have any
