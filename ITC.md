### ‚úçÔ∏è Test Pattern
Gamified testing done,Questions were of the type to just test your iq, all were easy tests to pass.
Test had 4 types of questions -
1) Numerical Section : They had given around 7 different types of graphs, we have to take inference from the graph and answer the questions given , there were 18 statements given which we have to allot them into 3 categories - True,False or can't say, There was even an option to skip the question and move on to the next question.
2) Inductive Section : you are given patterns in 3*3 grids, the patterns may be of position or number of dominant symbol, to show the pattern 2 grids are given and you have to select which 2 of the 4 options follow this rule. For this section 6 minutes were given and we could solve infinite questions. 
3) Semi-Sudoku : You are given a n*m grid, and some symbols , each symbol comes once per row and column and you have to fill the question mark. There are 2 strategies either spam answers based on the sudoku logic and fill all empty squares in your brain to get the question mark symbol or just see the row and column where the question mark is present then guess the answer.
I reached level 24 with the first method and a friend reached the same with the latter method, first one is more accurate but score wise it'll show same as 2nd method.
4) Path Plan Game : grid is given, you have to move ball to goal by using minimum number of moves of blocks, this game was slightly tedious and the game was broken if you have extension, so advise will be to attempt it in chrome browser with all extensions disabled for the game to work correctly
