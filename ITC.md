### ‚úçÔ∏è Test Pattern
Above 8.9 was required to write the test as well, try to have CG high \n
Gamified testing done,Questions were of the type to just test your iq, all were easy tests to pass.
Test had 4 sections of questions and each section has time limit of 6 minutes -
1) Numerical Section : They had given around 7 different types of graphs, we have to take inference from the graph and answer the questions given , there were 18 statements given which we have to allot them into 3 categories - True,False or can't say, There was even an option to skip the question and move on to the next question.
2) Inductive Section : you are given patterns in 3*3 grids, the patterns may be of position or number of dominant symbol, to show the pattern 2 grids are given and you have to select which 2 of the 4 options follow this rule. For this section 6 minutes were given and we could solve infinite questions. 
3) Semi-Sudoku : You are given a n*m grid, and some symbols , each symbol comes once per row and column and you have to fill the question mark. There are 2 strategies either spam answers based on the sudoku logic and fill all empty squares in your brain to get the question mark symbol or just see the row and column where the question mark is present then guess the answer from the four options given.
I reached level 24 with the first method and a friend reached the same with the latter method, first one is more accurate but score wise it'll show same as 2nd method.
4) Path Plan Game : grid is given, you have to move ball to goal by using minimum number of moves of blocks, this game was slightly tedious and the game was broken if you have extension, so advise will be to attempt it in chrome browser with all extensions disabled for the game to work correctly

### üë• GD Pattern
Given a 1 page long situation and you have to give priority order for many objects and we have to come to a conclusion as a group as to what priority order we should keep.I think time limit was around 10 minutes.
My task was like we were in a plane from kolkata to Silchar and we crashlanded in a tropical forest in Manipur, pilot died and we have about 15 items like first aid kit,radio transmitter,golf sticks,gun, machete,chocolate bars,etc and we had to make a priority order for all these item.
(All groups had different task so no point preparing for any specific task) 
What they look for in GD is how well you communicate, how well you can pursuade others by speaking logically and have them choose your opinion.In my GD specifically i was able to make everyone follow the priority order that i had in mind and I gave a logical reasoning for it to my group, but you should be able to accept ideas from others as well,because reaching to a group consensus is more important.
While doing the GD be respectful of other and don't cut them off in the middle. have a collaborative outlook, in my case me and one more person who I didnt know before the GD made a synergy where i would agree to his points and push for them as well and he would do the same for me, in the end both of us were taken for pre-interview round.

### üë• Interview Pattern

There were **2 rounds of interview** for KITES ‚Äî 

1) First round is pre-interview which happened few hours after GD, This is the real interview where real shortlisting occurs, final interview is just a formality, here 2 people take your interview, one will be HR and the other is Technical.
   First question in all interviews is introduce yourself(Have an answer prepared for this before since every interview you have will have this).They will ask your family background so know what your parents and direct sibling is doing.
   They ask curvy questions like why FMCG why not core engineering? why did you choose electrical engineering? What do you plan to achieve? What are your past failures and how you overcame them, sort of stuff, try looking into common HR questions on google since these guys do care about HR. Have some POR in which you work as a team and go to some competition since you can frame up some past experiences for HR rounds. Since there are questions of how you have worked in teams.
   they will ask cross questions for whatever answer you give for questions as well.
   Technical they will probably ask you your favourite subjects in the past, i told probability and since i said probability for electrical engineers they started asking me what was so special about this course that included electrical engineering, i didnt have an answer so i told course was taken by elec profs and they started laughing. They asked me one question from probability for which i was prepared since my main prep was in quant. Other question they asked was in impedance and how to detect metals using it on conveyer belt I wasn't sure about the answer but I was able to explain that I know the underlying concepts that they were asking me for.
   
   
2) Second round was chill, It was about 10 minutes and if you get to this round then you are as good as selected, everyone who gave interview got offer, they will ask easy questions like where do you want to work and why FMCG again. Just answer anything you want and its peace.

### üìö Resources Used

- Read JD before entering the interview
- For the test you can try playing some pymetric games on apps like luminosity(not really related and might not help much)

---

### ‚ùå Mistakes Made
- Dont say anything negative about yourself in interview and dont say any negative past incident from which you cant dig yourself out of.
---

### üí° Tips
- Have resume vetted by multiple seniors.
- Have good team POR's something like comp teams or Managorial POR's(I had both) for telling stories about yourself in interview since its easy to get out of questions using them.
