### üë• Interview Pattern 

#### 1. Round 1
* A warmup round that involves a few generic questions about yourself, some quantitative puzzles, some questions on algorithms and a few questions on derivatives and their types
* Very important - brush up the following financial concepts, you do not need to study them in depth unless you have explained them on your resume (I myself read about them just before my interview) - Equity, securities, stocks, bonds, derivatives and their types (futures, forwards, options and swaps), ETFs and Mutual Funds. This information is also useful for other related quant role interviews. 
* This round is moslty to identify your suitability for the role, and acts as a basic screening round

#### 2. Round 2
* This round goes into your resume, especially the projects that you have mentioned relevant to the profile. Since my resume had ML projects, I was asked questions on LSTMs, autoregression, data preprocessing and dataset management, since the Trading role involves ML.
* Questions relating to quantitative reasoning and probability puzzles are more difficult and invovled than in the first round, especially because my resume suggested a more quant background. Questions were similar to typical quant interview problems.
* If you are unaware of some financial concepts, the interviewer might explain those briefly and then ask you questions on it to test if you grasp the underlying mathematics.

#### 3. Round 3
* By this round, the hiring team develops an understanding of your strengths and weaknesses and which role or projects you would demonstrate proficiency in. Hence, the questions are more specific, and there are not many questions.
* Quantitative puzzles of a similar nature as round 2 along with coding knowledge is tested.
* A general pattern in the rounds so far is that your ability to communicate well and clearly is also tested, and the way you present yourself is very important. 

#### 4. HR round
* Owing to how detailed the past 3 rounds were, the HR round does not take too long.
* In many cases, it is a test of whether you really would accept the offer and enjoy your time at JPMC. Questions about future goals, past experiences and company preferences are asked.
* In my case, my resume had a lot of ML Research in it, so the HR told me that the Trading role essentially involves ML and Quant, and the projects of the AI&ML department at JPMC are also under the CIB umbrella, which Trading is in.
* This round requires you to be honest and clear about what you want.

### üìö Resources Used
The most important thing is to ensure your probability, quantitative basics and communication skills are strong. Taking part in several mock (or real) quant interviews will give you ample practice for these roles. 
A collection of commonly cited useful resources for such roles are:
* Brainstellar
* Heard on the Street
* 50 Challenging Problems in Probability
* Neetcode.io
* Khan Academy videos for financial concepts - Finance and Capital Markets

### ‚ùå Mistakes I made and Tips

* I did not consider the internship season as a pressing priority and was unavailable throughout the summer, which led to me applying only for 6-7 companies and not being able to prepare for more than a week.
* While there might be a significant component of luck associated with the intern season, the efforts you put in will make your intern season smoother and more fruitful. Don't feel you aren't "smart" enough, there is nearly no role of said "smartness" in the kind of offer you can get.
* TL;DR - The sky is the limit, but only your confidence and efforts can take you there.
* Also, be very clear about the kind of roles you want to be a part of in your career. There is no point in applying for companies and roles you ultimately are not interested in working in, because it draws out prep time from roles you actually are interested in.
