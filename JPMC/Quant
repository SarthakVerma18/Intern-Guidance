### JPMC came with 4 roles(Not in any particular order):
1) Quant Research
2) Trading and Structuring
3) Strategic Engineering Growth Program
4) Sales



### ✍️ Test Pattern for Quant Research(Others available in respective files)

Paper 1: MCQ 30 questions 35 minutes based on 
Section A: Probability and Statitics------>12 questions, 1 mark for correct answer, -0.25 for incorrect
Section B: General Mathematics------> 8 questions, 1 mark for correct answer, -0.25 for incorrect
Section C: Computer Science------> 10 questions, 1 mark for correct answer, -0.25 for incorrect

Paper 2: Coding Questions
60 minutes 2 questions:
3 marks for first
5 marks for second


The test was one of the most difficult tests I had taken during the intern season.

But again, they did not go on to ask any of the questions that appeared in the test for the interview.

### 👥 Interview Pattern

4 rounds of interview. All were offline and were conducted one after another in quick succession moving from one room to another with a different interviewer each time

1) Coding Round:
👉 No actual programming. Just pseudocode.
👉 First question: Given an array, find the second largest element
👉 Second question: What is the DFS algorithm?
👉 Third question: Using DFS, find the minimum and maximum distance between 2 given nodes in a graph.
👉 Fourth question: What is the time complexity of the algorithm suggested in 3rd question?
👉 Fifth question: What is the Bellman-Ford Algorithm?(I had it on my resume, hence he asked).

Note guys, the third question does not make sense. I had to clarify a lot to reach at the final and clear problem statement. This is how they grasp how the candidate structures
his/her thoughts and that is the basis of their selection criteria.

He entered the room with a completely negative demeanour of not selecting me and in fact spent the first 10 minutes of the 30 minute interview explaining why I should not join this
role. This was since I told him I like quant research and he realized I meant HFTs(which I did). His point was that I should not come to JPMC since it is not an HFT. 
Thus, you should carefully choose your words, and more than that, you should be crystal clear about the role and the firm.

2) Maths Round:
👉 First question: The interviewer after getting to know that I am in Electrical, asked me bluntly what is a BLDC Motor. I told him what is a DC motor, and why we need brushes in it. Then I told
him that about EML(a course in 4th Sem), and that BLDC was not taught in EML, hence I don't know. He seemed satisfied.
👉 Second question: Then he asked me what the methods to cool a transformer 
👉 Third question: We have 2 jars, 50 good candies in one jar, and 50 rotten in other.
A) What is the probability of choosing a good candy if any jar is selected randomly.
B) How to redistribute the candies within the jar so that the probablity of choosing a good candy increases?
I struggled in B). I asked him for a hint. He helped. Step by step I reached the solution.

👉 Fourth question: What is the expected number of coin tosses for a fair coin to get the sequence 'HH'? 
Knowing what Markov Chains are, I answered promptly, making even for the struggle in the previous question.

👉 Fifth question: Seeing Black Scholes model on my resume, he asked me what are the basic assumptions of Black Scholes.
I listed out three. But he had a particular one on his mind. I could not get at it, but tried my best by writing down the equation and explaining each term to him and trying
to derive the assumptions from the equation. He told it to me finally, and I agreed profusely with him. In such a situation, you have to convince him that the answer is 
obvious and trivial

3) HR Round:
She asked me a bunch of questions about myself and of the projects on my resume. You have to be all smiles and protray as if all your time belongs to them.

4) Mixed Bag:
This was taken by a senior member of the team that came to insti. Before asking any question, he spent about 3 minutes(an age in that scenario) just reading my resume in a 
pin drop silence.
👉 First question:
Given 2 histograms, how to transfer mass from the first one to the second with minimal cost. The cost being the distance multiplied by the mass transferred. This was a very 
diagrammatic question. It took to about 3-4 minutes to clarify the question and get it to the form above. Then seeing me struggle a bit, he told me to form it as an 
optimization problem, with an objecive function and constraints. I proposed a solution. He didn't seem convinced with the Time Complexity. I then suggested using a DP table.
He still was not satisfied(since the solution was really complex). Then I suggested him to think about the LCS(Longest Common Subsequence) Problem and how we solve it using
a 2-D DP. He then was satisfied.
👉 Second question:
He then asked me a barrage of deep and fundamental questions about my Black-Scholes model project. The rest of the interview was spent on this. This was quite exhaustive and 
he got out of me many concepts in EE3110(Elec. Probab). I had read my short notes for the course theday before, and it helped a lot.

👉 Last question:
He informed me that this role does not match with my interests(the first guy must've told him something lol..). I had to give a diplomatic response.
